# California House Price Prediction using ML
Libraries used: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn, xgboost.                                                                                      
Model Development: Implemented and trained an XGBoost Regressor model for house price prediction; effectively split the dataset into training and testing sets to ensure robust model performance.
Performance Evaluation: Assessed model accuracy using R squared error and Mean Absolute Error; created scatter plots to compare actual and predicted prices for better visualization and understanding.
